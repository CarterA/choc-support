I was going to get an early night actually, just in case alextgordon @ 03:19	

why ? Silvertab @ 03:20
i.e. why would it be today? 03:20

it's a tuesday alextgordon @ 03:21	

ah Silvertab @ 03:21	
Silvertab came back 17:13	

clients... Silvertab @ 17:38
I fuckin hate them... 17:38
 
well.. talk about non-useful feedback.. that's a bummer lol Silvertab @ 18:03	

haha alextgordon @ 18:03
yeah 18:03
so the takeaways are 18:04
better code completion 18:04
web inspector button? 18:04
 
something like that yeah Silvertab @ 18:04	

so what can we do about code completion? alextgordon @ 18:05
it would be nice if it supported CSS better 18:05
 
that's the thing.. I'm not really sure…  I mean every time I complained about it you basically told me I WAS WRONG Silvertab @ 18:05
18:05
 
it depends alextgordon @ 18:05
for python, there's a thin line we have to walk 18:06
between annoying and not 18:06
but for CSS it's easier 18:06
 
not for CSS Silvertab @ 18:06
I want it to be THERE ALL THE TIME 18:06
lol 18:06
 
ok then alextgordon @ 18:06	

not on backg[round-co]lor Silvertab @ 18:06
18:06
also, it should be smarter about the scopes 18:07
http://d.pr/i/40bb 18:07
this makes no sense 18:07
 
yeah alextgordon @ 18:07	

any way we could extend CTags without opening our veins? Silvertab @ 18:11
i.e. it could easily show CSS selectors 18:11
 
yeah it's easy alextgordon @ 18:11
diglett is extensible 18:11
you can have different indexers 18:11
 
cool Silvertab @ 18:13
what 18:13
would 18:13
be 18:13
cool 18:13
is for digglet to be able to use scope selectors 18:13
this way the work would already be done 18:13
haha 18:13
 
impossible alextgordon @ 18:13
18:13
diglett is a separate process 18:14
and has to index files which may not be opened 18:14
the only way you could do it would be to have it part of chocolat, completely separate from diglett 18:14
 
oh no but I meant.. for digglet to parse chocolat's truffle for example… i.e. you specify a scope in some config file Silvertab @ 18:15
and digglet gets the regex from the truffle 18:15
i.e.  "function" : "source.function.name" 18:15
and it would check out (for example) the javascript truffle to find out this selector, get the regex 18:15
and know that this should be a "function" in the symbol list 18:16
not sure if you get what I'm saying at all LOL 18:16
 
I see alextgordon @ 18:16
pretty much impossible though 18:16
truffles are very complex 18:16
 
I mean if themes can make use of scopes... Silvertab @ 18:16	

they don't alextgordon @ 18:17
scopes make use of themes 18:17
 
oh well, could be impossible, just thought it would be nice to not have to redefine regex twice... Silvertab @ 18:19	

it'll probably need a different regex, you see alextgordon @ 18:19	

in this case… nevermind I guess haha Silvertab @ 18:19	

so it seems like we should totally pimp code completion and web preview alextgordon @ 18:20	

yeah…although I mean Silvertab @ 18:21
web preview is sick 18:21
let's just add an inspector butotn 18:22
we already have that slick toolbar 18:22
 
almost done with that alextgordon @ 18:22
stylesheet overriding would be awesome 18:22
 
yeah Silvertab @ 18:22
mmm as for code completion.. yeah… like I said the context is being ignored, I don't know if it's something we can fix 18:22
 
brb lunch, but when I get back, let's do code completion alextgordon @ 18:23	

but it would help TREMENDOUSLY for code completion to be relevant Silvertab @ 18:23
any idea for that guy in the channel? 18:23
 
so alextgordon @ 18:40
code completion 18:41
let's list all the things wrong/needed 18:41
 
mmmm Silvertab @ 18:45	

so for one, when you're in CSS it should show immediately after you type a letter alextgordon @ 18:50
eg 18:50
.foo {
   x|
} 18:50
 
b: BACKGROUND ALL THE THINGS Silvertab @ 18:50
agreed... 18:50
 
so there's three places really alextgordon @ 18:50
A {
   B: C;
} 18:50
 
can we make it smarter though? with scopes? Silvertab @ 18:50
can we Mr. Gordon? CAN WE? 18:51
 
yep alextgordon @ 18:51	

sweet Silvertab @ 18:51	

it already uses scopes alextgordon @ 18:51
so what else 18:53
 
well besides being there all the time, and having proper scopes Silvertab @ 18:53
there's not much we can do! 18:53
imho, in CSS it should be there at the first letter…and stay there, unless I press "enter" 18:54
or whatever dismisses it 18:54
 
I think CSSEdit has the best code completion of anything alextgordon @ 18:54	

it does Silvertab @ 18:54
(or espresso) 18:54
 
I think we just have to be unprincipled and special case the fuck out of it alextgordon @ 18:55
18:55
 
I guess yeah Silvertab @ 18:57
imho: 18:57
the way Espresso does both html and css completion is stellar… but html might be a bit trickier 18:58
 
how does it do html completion? alextgordon @ 18:58
actually I've always liked Dreamweaver's html completion 18:58
that sounds crazy 18:58
dreamweaver has great html completion! 18:58
 
you have to try it out to understand Silvertab @ 18:59
type `<b` you will see a list of tags: http://d.pr/i/bfVf
type `<bo` it will narrow it down to the only tag: http://d.pr/i/qHiH
Press "enter" you get this: http://d.pr/i/LXO9 19:00
 
we can do that alextgordon @ 19:01	

what's better: our auto-indent is better Silvertab @ 19:01
although, Espresso's completion is entirely snippets based 19:02
i.e. insert Div and you get: http://d.pr/i/qpVw 19:02
with placeholders etc. 19:02
but, really, it makes typing html effortless 19:02
 
cool alextgordon @ 19:03
so what we need 19:03
is to work on the statics 19:04
list of tags, plus what they expand into 19:04
same for css 19:06
it would be good if CSS expanded properly 19:06
b[enter] -> background-color: |; 19:06
but only if the rest of the line after the cursor is empty 19:07
 
k Silvertab @ 19:07
mmm 19:07
html should be simple enough…in most case it's just completing the tag 19:08
i.e.   <small>|</small> 19:08
*some* have additional args… like div 19:08
 
we should make a list of those alextgordon @ 19:08
we need a list of all html tags (which we have I think) 19:09
 
espresso is also smart about completing arguments Silvertab @ 19:09	

mmm? alextgordon @ 19:09	

http://d.pr/i/A9G Silvertab @ 19:09	

also, now that snippets work, we can use those alextgordon @ 19:09
yeah 19:09
we need a list of which attributes apply to which tags 19:09
 
another thing which I like, but…I doubt we can do it Silvertab @ 19:10	

w3 has one for html4: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html alextgordon @ 19:10	

</  completes the proper tag Silvertab @ 19:10
I know we have a command to do it 19:10
but invoking it with </  is genius 19:10
 
we can do that alextgordon @ 19:10
lets write all of this down before it's forever lost in adium's transcript 19:11
https://piratenpad.de/p/nK1186e0lM 19:11
 
there's only one area where Espresso will always be smarter but I don't mind personally Silvertab @ 19:13	

mmm? alextgordon @ 19:13	

and its in… nested completion…  i.e. it will not complete <div   if you are not inside a <body>  tag, etc... Silvertab @ 19:14	

I'm confused? alextgordon @ 19:15
won't complete div inside body 19:15
? 19:15
 
typing <d   will not yield anything if you are not inside <body></body> tags Silvertab @ 19:15	

ahh right alextgordon @ 19:16
yeah that's quite tricky 19:16
 
I don't really mind however Silvertab @ 19:16
it's nice but…not essential 19:16
