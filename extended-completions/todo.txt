HTML/CSS code completion should be immediate
b -> background-color:

Make list of all HTML tags
Make list of all HTML attributes and which tags they apply to (start here: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html)
http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-index.html#attributes-1

Make list of all CSS properties (http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html )
Make list of all CSS values and which properties they apply to (e.g. "hidden" for "visibility")
Create snippets for tags that require them (e.g. <div> => <div%{1=" id=\"%{2}\"}>%{0}</div>

Manually order tags, properties, attributes, values by likelihood (e.g. nobody every uses background-clip)

</ should try to close proper tag

Stylesheet overriding would be AWESOME


Tags that might require snippets (rough list):
a
div
link
html
body
head
script
style

-- Also some tags are "blocky", such as <div> which should expand into 3 lines:
   <div>
      ...
   </div>
   
   whereas inline tags such as <b> obviously should not.
